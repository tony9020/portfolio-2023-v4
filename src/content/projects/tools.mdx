I made some useful tools and hosted them on [tools.tonychristopherofficial.com](https://tools.tonychristopherofficial.com) I want to practice my programming skills. Learning different techniques by making different tools, such as making and view PDF is not easy, and color is also a science

Hope the tools I made help you!
